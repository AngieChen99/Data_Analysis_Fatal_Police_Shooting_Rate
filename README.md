# Fatal_Police_Shooting_Rate


# Intro
The chosen data set briefs on the demographics of people killed in police shootings in the United States of America from the year 2000 to 2015. 
It provides data on the age, gender, race, city and state they were killed in by the police. 
The data set also further provides information on whether the person was armed or was his mental condition stable or did he make an attempt to flee the scene. Given the recent events with police shootings and the debate that has arisen on racial disparities and breach of human rights on use of police force, this dataset will help in dissecting the on ground scenario and will allow us to uncover some important facts.

Washington Post claims that the dataset is updated regularly as facts emerge about every individual police shooting case.
